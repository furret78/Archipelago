## What is the goal of 100th Black Market when randomized?
There are five goals to reach for in this implementation.
- Complete the full story line. This means defeating not just the boss of End of Market, but also the hidden bosses of the 4th and 6th Market.
- Complete the minimum story line. This means only defeating the hidden boss of the 6th Market is necessary.
- Collect all Ability Cards.
- Defeat all bosses.
- And both of the above.

Nepley, for their work on AP implementations for Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, Perfect Cherry Blossom, and Imperishable Night. Their work has been borrowed as a framework for implementing AP into 100th Black Market. They have also helped with disabling the game's anticheat in order for AP to properly function.

Doremy, for playtesting.
